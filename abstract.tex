In Brazil, there are tools for monitoring the behaviour of legislators in
rollcalls, such as O Estado de São Paulo's Basômetro and Radar Parlamentar.
These tools are used both by journalists and political scientists for analysis.

Although they are great analysis tools, their usefulness for monitoring is
limited because they require a manual follow-up, which makes it a lot of work
when we consider the volume of data. Only in the Chamber of Deputies, 513
legislators participate on average over than 400 rollcalls by legislature. It
is possible to decrease the amount of data analyzing the parties as a whole,
but in contrast we lose the ability to detect individuals' drives or
intra-party groups such as factions.

In order to mitigate this problem, I developed a statistical model that detects
when a legislator changes his or her position, joining or leaving the
governmental coalition, through ideal points estimates using the W-NOMINATE. It
can be used individually or integrated to tools such as Basômetro, providing a
filter for researchers find the deputies who changed their behaviour most
significantly.

The universe of study is composed of legislators from the Chamber of Deputies
from the 50th to the 54th legislatures, starting in the first term of Fernando
Henrique Cardoso in 1995 until the end of the first term of Dilma Rousseff in
2015.
