      atores coletivos, no caso os partidos pol\'{\i}ticos, utilizam as trocas
      de legenda para aumentar seu poder na arena parlamentar e na arena
      eleitoral. N\~{a}o pretendo com isto afirmar que os parlamentares n\~{a}o
      busquem aumentar suas chances de sucesso quando trocam de partido, ao
      contr\'{a}rio, o que pretendo \'{e} mostrar que, se ocorre
      migra\c{c}\~{a}o partid\'{a}ria, \'{e} porque os deputados percebem a
      import\^{a}ncia dos partidos para seus objetivos. Mais do que isso, o que

      acesso a cargos no legislativo e para aumentar seus votos em regi\~{o}es

@article{Poole2000,
  abstract = {This paper shows a general nonparametric unfolding technique for
    maximizing the correct classification of binary choice or two-category
      data. The motivation for and the primary focus of the unfolding technique
      are parliamentary roll call voting data. However, the procedures that
      implement the unfolding also can be applied to the problem of unfolding
      rank order data as well as analyzing a data set that would normally be
      the subject of a probit, logit, or linear probability analysis. One
      aspect of the scaling method greatly improves Manski's "maximum score
      estimator" technique for estimating limited dependent variable models. To
      unfold binary choice data two subproblems must be solved. First, given a
      set of chooser or legislator points, a cutting plane must be found such
      that it divides the legislators/choosers into two sets that reproduce the
      actual choices as closely as possible. Second, given a set of cutting
      planes for the binary choices, a point for each chooser or legislator
      must be found which reproduces the actual choices as closely as possible.
      Solutions for these two problems are shown in this paper. Monte Carlo
      tests of the procedure show it to be highly accurate in the presence of
      voting error and missing data.},

@article{Jackman2000,
  abstract = {Bayesian statistics have made great strides in recent years,
    developing a class of methods for estimation and inference via stochastic
      simulation known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. MCMC
      constitutes a revolution in statistical practice with effects beginning
      to be felt in the social sciences: models long consigned to the "too
      hard" basket are now within reach of quantitative researchers. I review
      the statistical pedigree of MCMC and the underlying statistical concepts.
      I demonstrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of MCMC and offer
      practical suggestions for using MCMC in social-science settings. Simple,
    illustrative examples include a probit model of voter turnout and a linear
      regression for time-series data with autoregressive disturbances. I
      conclude with a more challenging application, a multinomial probit model,
    to showcase the power of MCMC methods.},

@article{Leoni2002,
  abstract = {In this work we apply quantitative methods to recover the
    individual preferences of Brazilian representatives, as expressed in their
      nominal votes in the 49th and 50th legislatures. The method assumes both
      the rational choice and spatial theories of voting. Empirical analyses
      show that Brazilian representatives can be accurately positioned in a
      single ideological continuum that reflects, in part, the consensus of
      Brazilian politics observers: members of the Partido dos Trabalhadores
      (PT – Workers' Party) are positioned at the extreme left and those of
      the Frente Liberal (PFL – Liberal Front) at the opposite end. The Partido
      da Social Democracia Brasileira (PSDB – Party of the Brazilian Social
          Democracy), in turn, moved from a center-left position in the 49th
      legislature to the right, in the 50th. Additional dimensions contribute
      very little to the explanatory capacity of the model. The spatial
      positioning of representatives of a same party vary significantly, and
      the paramount quality of the statistical model used is its capacity to
      provide us with a spatial interpretation of this variation. The first
      dimension is rather stable in both legislatures. Circumstantial evidence
      is raised to support the hypothesis that these dimensions reflect the
      relationship between the Executive and the Legislative branches of
      government. During this period, the Presidents of the Republic were
      located at the extreme right of the political space.},

@article{Shor2010,
  abstract = {Researchers face two major problems when applying ideal point
    estimation techniques to state legislatures. First, longitudinal roll-call
      data are scarce. second, even when such data exist, scaling ideal points
      within a single state is an inadequate approach. No comparisons can be
      made between these estimates and those for other state legislatures or
      for Congress. our project provides a solution. We exploit a new
        comparative dataset of state legislative roll calls to generate ideal
          points for legislators. taking advantage of the fact that state
          legislators sometimes go on to serve in Congress, we create a common
          ideological scale. Using these bridge actors, we estimate state
          legislative ideal points in congressional common space for 11 states.
          We present our results and illustrate how these scores can be used to
          address important topics in state and legislative politics.},
