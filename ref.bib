@article{Poole2000,
  abstract = {This paper shows a general nonparametric unfolding technique for
    maximizing the correct classification of binary choice or two-category
      data. The motivation for and the primary focus of the unfolding technique
      are parliamentary roll call voting data. However, the procedures that
      implement the unfolding also can be applied to the problem of unfolding
      rank order data as well as analyzing a data set that would normally be
      the subject of a probit, logit, or linear probability analysis. One
      aspect of the scaling method greatly improves Manski's "maximum score
      estimator" technique for estimating limited dependent variable models. To
      unfold binary choice data two subproblems must be solved. First, given a
      set of chooser or legislator points, a cutting plane must be found such
      that it divides the legislators/choosers into two sets that reproduce the
      actual choices as closely as possible. Second, given a set of cutting
      planes for the binary choices, a point for each chooser or legislator
      must be found which reproduces the actual choices as closely as possible.
      Solutions for these two problems are shown in this paper. Monte Carlo
      tests of the procedure show it to be highly accurate in the presence of
      voting error and missing data.},

    developing a class of methods for estimation and inference via stochastic
      simulation known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. MCMC
      constitutes a revolution in statistical practice with effects beginning
      to be felt in the social sciences: models long consigned to the "too
      hard" basket are now within reach of quantitative researchers. I review
      the statistical pedigree of MCMC and the underlying statistical concepts.
      I demonstrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of MCMC and offer
      practical suggestions for using MCMC in social-science settings. Simple,
    illustrative examples include a probit model of voter turnout and a linear
      regression for time-series data with autoregressive disturbances. I
      conclude with a more challenging application, a multinomial probit model,
    to showcase the power of MCMC methods.},

@article{Leoni2002,
  abstract = {In this work we apply quantitative methods to recover the
    individual preferences of Brazilian representatives, as expressed in their
      nominal votes in the 49th and 50th legislatures. The method assumes both
      the rational choice and spatial theories of voting. Empirical analyses
      show that Brazilian representatives can be accurately positioned in a
      single ideological continuum that reflects, in part, the consensus of
      Brazilian politics observers: members of the Partido dos Trabalhadores
      (PT – Workers' Party) are positioned at the extreme left and those of
      the Frente Liberal (PFL – Liberal Front) at the opposite end. The Partido
      da Social Democracia Brasileira (PSDB – Party of the Brazilian Social
          Democracy), in turn, moved from a center-left position in the 49th
      legislature to the right, in the 50th. Additional dimensions contribute
      very little to the explanatory capacity of the model. The spatial
      positioning of representatives of a same party vary significantly, and
      the paramount quality of the statistical model used is its capacity to
      provide us with a spatial interpretation of this variation. The first
      dimension is rather stable in both legislatures. Circumstantial evidence
      is raised to support the hypothesis that these dimensions reflect the
      relationship between the Executive and the Legislative branches of
      government. During this period, the Presidents of the Republic were
      located at the extreme right of the political space.},

  abstract = {Researchers face two major problems when applying ideal point
    estimation techniques to state legislatures. First, longitudinal roll-call
      data are scarce. second, even when such data exist, scaling ideal points
      within a single state is an inadequate approach. No comparisons can be
      made between these estimates and those for other state legislatures or
      for Congress. our project provides a solution. We exploit a new
        comparative dataset of state legislative roll calls to generate ideal
          points for legislators. taking advantage of the fact that state
          legislators sometimes go on to serve in Congress, we create a common
          ideological scale. Using these bridge actors, we estimate state
          legislative ideal points in congressional common space for 11 states.
          We present our results and illustrate how these scores can be used to
          address important topics in state and legislative politics.},

  abstract = {When modeling discrete classes, the relative frequencies of the
    classes can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the model. An
      imbalance occurs when one or more classes have very low proportions in
      the training data as compared to the other classes. Imbalance can be
      present in any data set or application, and hence, the practitioner
      should be aware of the implications of modeling this type of data. To
      illustrate the impacts and remedies for severe class imbalance, we
      present a case study example (Section 16.1) and the impact of class
      imbalance on performances measures (Section 16.2). Sections 16.3-16.6
      describe approaches for handling imbalance using the existing data such
      as maximizing minority class accuracy, adjusting classification cut-offs
      or prior probabilities, or adjusting sample weights prior to model
      tuning. Handling imbalance can also be done through sophisticated up- or
      down-sampling methods (Section 16.7) or by applying costs to the
      classification errors (Section 16.8). In the Computing Section (16.9) we
      demonstrate how to implement these remedies in R. Finally, exercises are
      provided at the end of the chapter to solidify the concepts.},

    several phases since democratisation in 1985. In the early years of
      democracy, pessimism prevailed with regard to governability. This view
      gave way in the mid-1990s to a more optimistic view that stressed two
      innovations of the Constitution of 1988: enhanced presidential power and
      centralised legislative procedure. In recent years, a third phase of
      research has shifted attention to the crucial role of inter-party
      alliances. These analytical approaches have converged into an emerging
      research programme on coalitional presidentialism, which places
      executive-legislative relations at the centre stage of macropolitical
      analysis. This article reviews the three phases of the debate and

  abstract = {We describe a method for statistical learning from speech
    documents that we apply to the Congressional Record in order to gain new
      insight into the dynamics of the political agenda. Prior efforts to
      evaluate the attention of elected representatives across topic areas have
      largely been expensive manual coding exercises and are generally
      circumscribed along one or more features of detail: limited time periods,
    high levels of temporal aggregation, and coarse topical categories.
      Conversely, the Congressional Record has scarcely been used for such
      analyses, largely because it contains too much information to absorb
      manually. We describe here a method for inferring, through the patterns
      of word choice in each speech and the dynamics of word choice patterns
      across time, (a) what the topics of speeches are, and (b) the probability
      that attention will be paid to any given topic or set of topics over
      time. We use the model to examine the agenda in the United States Senate
      from 1997-2004, based on a new database of over 70 thousand speech
      documents containing over 70 million words. We estimate the model for 42
      topics and provide evidence that we can reveal speech topics that are
      both distinctive and inter-related in substantively meaningful ways. We
      demonstrate further that the dynamics our model gives us leverage into
      important questions about the dynamics of the political agenda.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of social media for political
    communication creates unprecedented opportunities to monitor the opinions
      of large numbers of politically active individuals in real time. However,
    without a way to distinguish between users of opposing political
      alignments, conflicting signals at the individual level may, in the
      aggregate, obscure partisan differences in opinion that are important to
      political strategy. In this article we describe several methods for
      predicting the political alignment of Twitter users based on the content
      and structure of their political communication in the run-up to the 2010
      U.S. midterm elections. Using a data set of 1,000 manually-annotated
      individuals, we find that a support vector machine (SVM) trained on hash
      tag metadata outperforms an SVM trained on the full text of users'
      tweets, yielding predictions of political affiliations with 91\%
      accuracy. Applying latent semantic analysis to the content of users'
      tweets we identify hidden structure in the data strongly associated with
      political affiliation, but do not find that topic detection improves
      prediction performance. All of these content-based methods are
      outperformed by a classifier based on the segregated community structure
      of political information diffusion networks (95\% accuracy). We conclude
      with a practical application of this machinery to web-based political
      advertising, and outline several approaches to public opinion monitoring
      based on the techniques developed herein.},
